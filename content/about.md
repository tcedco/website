## What is Codects?

Codects is a project series where I, Sami Elsayed, explore different types of programming projects and tech concepts. The goal is to dive into various topics, ranging from web development to machine learning, and share my experiences and insights along the way. Through these projects, I aim to provide a mix of theoretical knowledge and practical applications, making it easier for others to learn and experiment with new technologies.

Here are just some of my interests:

- Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning
- Web Development
- Cybersecurity
- Linux/UNIX
- Physics
- Mathematics
- ...and more!

## Why read Codects?

Codects is designed to be a learning resource for anyone interested in coding, tech, or just curious about how things work. Whether you're a beginner looking to start your coding journey or an experienced developer seeking new challenges, Codects offers a wide range of projects and topics to explore. Each project is documented with detailed explanations, code snippets, and insights into the learning process, providing a valuable resource for anyone looking to expand their knowledge.

## Who is Sami Elsayed?

I'm a Senior at TJHSST, and the current Lead Sysadmin at the tjCSL. As a Sysadmin, I work with networking, computer clusters, workstations, documentation, and web development to support over 2,000+ students and staff for their academic and research endeavors. I'm also the Co-Founder of the Cardinal Development Organization and the current Head Writer of "The Techbook." My passion for technology and coding has led me to explore various projects and topics, from building web servers to diving into machine learning algorithms. Through Codects, I hope to share my experiences, challenges, and discoveries with others who share a similar passion for coding and tech.
